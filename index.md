# The No Bullsh*t Guide To Fitness

In the last fifteen years, the fitness industry has seen an explosion in popularity. With the rise, however, it has made it harder for the average person to discern what is real and applicable information, and what is snake oil designed to sell products.

That's why I wrote this guide to help people who want to get fit but donâ€™t want to have to weed out all the misinformation the fitness industry contains. I wanted to include an approach to fitness and dieting that was easy to sustain, as I believe if something's not enjoyable, you won't continue to do it.

I tailored this guide towards men. However, most of the information in this guide is applicable to women as well.
