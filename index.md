# The No Bullsh*t Guide To Fitness

In the last fifteen years, the fitness industry has seen an explosion in popularity. With the rise, however, it has made it harder for the average person to discern what is real and applicable information, and what is snake oil designed to sell products.

That's why I wrote this guide to help people, like me a few years ago, who want to get fit but donâ€™t want to have to weed out all the misinformation the fitness industry contains.

The other reason I wrote this guide is because I believe that an easier approach to dieting and lifting is needed. A workout that only requires you to go to the gym 2-3 times a week, and a diet that is enjoyable and sustainable.

I wrote this guide for men as I believe that a the typical man's goal physique differs quite a bit from a woman's. Having said that, almost all of the information in this guide is also applicable to women.
